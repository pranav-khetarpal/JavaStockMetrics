# JavaStockMetrics
This is a project I worked on in the summer of 2023, from around May to July. I designed Java programs to prompt users for a stock, and would then return statistics and technical indicator information to the user on demand. The metrics could the be used, alongside recommendations, by the user to analyze buy and sell periods for a given stock.
